# NAUTOBOT

Nautobot is an open-source network infrastructure management platform that serves as a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for network infrastructure information. 
It enables organizations to document, visualize, and manage their network infrastructure efficiently. Nautobot provides a centralized platform that offers detailed 
insights into network data, including device details, IP address management (IPAM), interface configurations, and more.

While similar to NetBox, which also serves as a network SSOT, Nautobot stands out due to its enhanced features, extensibility, and broader purposes. 
Both Nautobot and NetBox are built using the Python Django framework.
